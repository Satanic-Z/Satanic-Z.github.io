**By Yifan Zhou**

The market downturn that began the day before yesterday came to a decisive end last night. For many, their crypto journey ended with it, including not just countless retail investors but also a number of "A8 players" (those with fortunes over $10 million).

Yet in my world, it was quiet. My circle consists solely of blockchain researchers, academics deeply immersed in their work. Yesterday, the group chats I’m in were almost completely silent—no one was wailing about their losses. My friends can tell you what the best current consensus algorithm is, explain every MPT variant, and describe what the frontier of public chain development looks like. Yet, believe it or not, only half of them even own a crypto wallet.

The Blockchain world and the Crypto world are incredibly divided. Both groups champion the same ideal of decentralization, yet their focuses are entirely different.

The Blockchain world is concerned with mechanism design: How are Sui’s smart contracts implemented? What is Ethereum’s Beacon Chain? How did Ethereum transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake?

The Crypto world is concerned with capital flows and how narratives catch fire: Which coin is listing today? Which token unlocks tomorrow? Where is the next airdrop, the next snapshot, the next pocket of dense futures liquidity?

The two rarely intersect. The Blockchain world has a massive contingent of people without wallets. The Crypto world has a huge number of people who have never even read the Bitcoin whitepaper.

Because of this schism, the entry point to Crypto for both the Blockchain world and the Web2 world is often hijacked by a chorus of Crypto-bashing media headlines: *"Market in Freefall! Over 1.5 Million Liquidated!"* For Crypto, this is simply an outcome, a market event. For the outside world, however, the Blockchain world is forced to be the scapegoat. In the early days, people in this field were afraid to even say what they did for a living. Just last year, a relative berated me: "You work in blockchain? You can't get involved in that stuff, it's all scams." At first, I would try to argue that "only 95% of it is a scam" (which is, frankly, true). Now, I just admit I chose the wrong field. "You're right, I should have just stuck with AI, right?"

For the Crypto world, a market crash is a chain reaction of liquidations caused by thin order books, over-leveraged traders, and broken hedges from market makers. It has absolutely nothing to do with whether "BTC is trash, and ETH is the trash of all trash." What’s even more hilarious is how the Crypto world fires back with memes like, *"Virtual currencies are going to zero, but look at China's A-share market breaking 3000 points and standing tall!"* I wonder if the person who wrote that headline ever imagined crypto would reach the heights it has today, and if that thought sends a shiver down their spine.

We in the blockchain world are done being the scapegoat. What needs to be understood is that the relationship isn't even a simple one of research (Blockchain) leading to production (Crypto). Instead, it’s a chain: **Research (the Blockchain world) → Production (deployment, dApps, etc.) → Speculation (the Crypto world)**. And the connection between production and speculation might be worth a dime at best.

There are reasons for these phenomena. The fact that so many researchers I know don't have wallets stems from this incredibly weak correlation between blockchain tech and crypto prices. Blockchain researchers focus on mechanisms and nodes. They work on timelines of quarters or years, and their work is judged by metrics like usability, security, and performance. Their research is funded by foundations and VCs, and their involvement often ends at the production stage.

The leap from production to speculation is where things get surreal. The Crypto world focuses on financial narratives. They work on timelines of days or weeks, and their success is measured by price and TVL. Hype is generated and sustained by public opinion.

Once we understand this relationship, we need to ask why it happens and what the right path forward is. There are two root causes for this disconnect:

First, **Crypto speculation is not judged by the quality of the underlying blockchain technology or the performance of the system.** It is judged by one thing: where capital is flowing. Take memes, for example. The market moves where the momentum is. As the meme goes: *"Don't research it too deeply, just buy it."* Sui was dumped relentlessly at first, only for its "value discovery" to begin later. Another classic example is how retail crypto traders constantly complain about Ethereum's high gas fees. However, high fees during congestion are a deliberate system design choice for security, not a flaw in the gas mechanism itself, which is actually excellent. Gas fees are high for security reasons. If ETH had the same security guarantees as Solana or BSC, it would be just as cheap to use.

Second, **the vast majority of academic blockchain research isn't aimed at benefiting real-world blockchains.** It's its own self-contained game. (I'm not talking about low-effort papers just trying to cash in on the blockchain trend; I'm referring to non-trivial work.) Take consensus algorithm research, for example. Academics are chasing lower complexity and permissionless settings, but the Crypto world couldn't care less. Even if they use your work, a simple two-chain HotStuff with a committee is good enough. This example may not be perfect, since BFT consensus predates blockchain, but the principle applies to many other areas of blockchain research.

Unlike the research-to-production pipeline in other industries, a deep fusion of the Blockchain and Crypto worlds is likely impossible. The most viable integration happens at the individual level: a person who exists in both circles simultaneously. However, it is extremely difficult for someone from one world to truly integrate into the other.

Crypto KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) travel the globe year-round, picking up a superficial understanding of various technologies. They might not even fully grasp the Bitcoin whitepaper, but their followers see them as technical trading gurus. On the other side, when a blockchain researcher tries to trade, they'll pick a few coins with strong technical fundamentals, only to watch them bleed all the way down. It's nearly impossible for a Crypto native to cross over into deep blockchain research. However, someone with deep blockchain expertise can at least *understand* what's happening in Crypto without waiting for an official announcement → a big KOL to broadcast it → for it to finally be chewed up and spoon-fed to them on X. But this requires researchers to be willing to look beyond academic papers and grant proposals and explore things like *why* HyperLiquid is so powerful, what technical innovations Pump.fun brought, or how cross-chain bridging works today. As I've said before, it all starts with creating a wallet and just experiencing things. This approach also works for Crypto natives who want to be fooled less by KOLs: raise your own cognitive level instead of blindly trusting them. I’m sure some KOLs feel a bit like impostors when they pretend to be technical experts.

My own market sense isn't sharp enough. After the crash yesterday, I tried to open a position on a CEX. It failed to go through for two minutes. Only in hindsight did I realize that opening a position on Hype (HyperLiquid) was the correct move. But at least I had that delayed realization, instead of being stuck in today's tired debate of "CEX is great for liquidity and insurance" vs. "DEX is great for uptime and low latency." When you realize that some of the loudest voices are all bark and no bite, you feel a sense of confidence even when you make a trading mistake. Thinking further, maybe I could be a KOL too. We’ve recently seen the rise of "mysticism KOLs" and all sorts of characters. If they can do it, so can I.

My X feed has been a goldmine these past few days. The algorithm recommends content based on what you view and follow, and lately, I can't even keep up with all the Crypto memes. I sincerely recommend my fellow blockchain researchers go and learn more about Crypto. If nothing else, it will add a bit of entertainment to an otherwise placid life.

When your relatives tell you there's no future in blockchain, you can smile and agree. When the LLM researchers mock you, you can say, "We still have ETH, and ETH will succeed... right?"

One day, everyone will use dApps built on Ethereum. On the day ETH finally succeeds, as the old poem goes: *"When victory is ours, do not forget to tell your father at his tomb."*
