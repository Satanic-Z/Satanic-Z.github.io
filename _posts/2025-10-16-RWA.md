There are quite a few crypto-stock platforms out there now. Robinhood and Kraken seem to be doing a solid job, mainly because you don't see them being shilled by KOLs, yet from what I can see, they have a good amount of organic traction. As for MyStonks, which is the one most heavily pushed by Chinese KOLs, it likely lacks technical depth.

The real game-changer for a crypto-stock platform would be the ability to truly bridge the liquidity between both worlds. However, there seems to be a fundamental dilemma between the stability and the decentralized nature of these platforms. They generally fall into one of two design patterns:

The first approach is based on **tokenized securities with ownership mapping and a redemption mechanism**. This requires some form of certification—at a minimum, KYC—so it's not fully decentralized. The trade-off is that a high degree of compliance brings strong stability. The existence of a redemption mechanism allows for arbitrage, which naturally supplements the token's price liquidity from the traditional stock market, reducing the pressure on market makers.

The second approach is **purely synthetic**. There is no ownership mapping or redemption for an underlying asset. Instead, it relies on oracles and funding rates to maintain the price peg. This design doesn't require KYC, but it means the tokenized stock is an isolated, siloed pool of liquidity, which puts immense pressure on market makers.

Unfortunately, I haven't used any of these platforms myself. Some have KYC requirements I can't pass, and others, like Robinhood, wouldn't even let me register with my email. I couldn't be bothered to jump through the hoops. MyStonks seems to be the easiest to get started with, but I have a hard time getting excited about any dApp that a horde of Chinese KOLs are fawning over, so I decided to pass on it.

That brings me to a question: are there any crypto-stock dApps out there that are technically strong but don't require KYC?
