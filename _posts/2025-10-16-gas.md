### Gas is About Security, Not Just Fees: Unpacking EIP-1559 and EIP-4844

Gas is a unified measurement of resources. It imposes a limit on the bandwidth, execution, storage, and other resources that a single block can consume.

To truly understand Ethereum, it's crucial to distinguish between the concepts of **gas as a security mechanism** and the **gas fee as an incentive**. The formula is simple: `Gas Fee = Gas Price * Gas Used`. The *fee* is an economic incentive. *Gas* itself, however, is a security concept at the protocol layer.

The primary reason for the existence of gas is to **preserve the network's synchronicity**. Blocks that are too large or take too long to execute can jeopardize this synchronicity, reducing the network's resilience and opening the door for security breaches. The real danger isn't the obvious external symptoms people talk aboutâ€”like network crashes, paralysis, or congestion. The critical issue is a silent, growing state inconsistency between nodes. This divergence undermines the **k-common prefix property** and the lack of a "common coin" constructed in logarithmic time, effectively erasing the chain's security guarantees.

The *fee*, on the other hand, is purely an incentive mechanism designed to manage demand and reward replicas (validators). EIP-1559 and EIP-4844 work in tandem to create a sophisticated two-dimensional fee market. This area has become a hotbed for research, particularly in the fields of game theory and empirical studies.

Before EIP-4844, there was EIP-4488, which lowered the gas cost per byte for `calldata`. To prevent potential DoS attacks from this change, a hard cap on total `calldata` per block was also introduced. These two EIPs represent a significant shift in the Ethereum Foundation's perspective on rollups. Initially, the EF believed that simply storing rollup data in `calldata` and making it cheaper would be enough to bring activity onto Layer 2s.

However, they later realized this approach created a tight and inefficient **coupling** of resources. L1's compute-intensive resources and rollups' data-storage-intensive needs were being priced together in a single, inefficient market. For example, when `calldata` usage hit its cap, rollup transactions were blocked. Their only option was to jack up their priority fees. This congestion would then spill over to affect unrelated transactions. Even if the block's overall gas limit was not reached, other compute-intensive transactions were forced to pay a higher priority fee just to get included. EIP-4844 solved this by introducing a separate, independent fee market for rollup data (blobs), effectively decoupling the two resource types.

This brings us to EIP-1559. It created a flexible block size (targeting 1x capacity but allowing up to 2x) and introduced the protocol-adjusted `base fee`. This portion of the transaction fee is burned. But *why* is it burned? What specific properties must this `base fee` satisfy? Very few articles bother to explain this. Most popular "explainers" on blockchain miss the forest for the trees. They tell you the burn is for making ETH deflationary, that ETH has a bright future, and that the value of your holdings will go up. They hype the price potential while completely ignoring the fundamental mechanics.

Let's be clear: significant ETH deflation is a distant dream. The on-chain activity required to achieve it simply isn't there yet. If you want to see real deflation, look at something like OKB, where massive official token burns caused its price to triple in a single day. For Ethereum, deflation is merely a side effect. The real reason for the burn is that the block producer (BP) has too much power. To ensure the BP honestly fulfills its duties as required by the protocol (like including the correct transactions in a block), the system needs what is called **"incentive compatibility"** in mechanism design.
Separating the BP's financial interest from the `base fee` is done to prevent the BP from manipulating the `base fee` by creating artificial scarcity. Therefore, the `base fee` *must not* go to the BP. Burning it is the mechanism to achieve this (which is why many people mistakenly believe the primary purpose is deflation).

This is also precisely why EIP-1559 must include a **tip**. Since the `base fee` is burned, there still has to be some benefit paid to the BP; otherwise, they would have no incentive to do their work.
