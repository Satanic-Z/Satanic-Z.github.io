Monad launched recently—I didn't bother tracking whether it was the testnet or mainnet. Monad (or, more accurately, its devoted flock of Key Opinion Leaders) claims it has achieved the next generation of blockchain architecture, supposedly ready to "dethrone" ETH and "crush" Solana. (I'm genuinely unsure why Solana is dragged into this; a comparison with Sui would at least be more technically logical).

Apparently, its specific mechanism is some form of "pre-execution." According to their marketing, this approach drastically improves execution performance, liberating blockchains from execution bottlenecks. Consequently, the user experience is set to be "revolutionized" thanks to its unique mechanics that allegedly increase TPS, lower latency, and drive gas fees to near-zero (I call this the "holy trinity of performance hype"). Therefore, Monad is unrivaled.

Setting aside the actual validity of Monad's claims or whether it delivers any real performance gains, these people are absolute masters of shilling. I used to think they were just fools, arguing black was white and stubbornly persisting even after being corrected. Now, I understand they have grasped the crypto industry’s core playbook: **relentlessly FUDing ETH.**

Today, they shill Monad, with its core feature of "pre-execution." To do this, they decry how slow the EVM is, how poorly Layer-2 solutions are developing, how difficult they are to use, and how ZK-EVMs are perpetually "just around the corner." Tomorrow, they will promote a different chain with $<1$s latency, and they will pivot to arguing how ETH’s $\approx 12$s block interval is "unacceptably absurd."

Why is FUDing ETH so effective? It’s simple: ETH's persistent failure to break $4,800 has left even long-term spot buyers underwater for five years. Add to that the false breakout last month, and who knows how many more years investors will be left holding the bag.

With so much pent-up frustration needing an outlet, all a KOL needs to gain the trust of retail investors and grow their following is a convenient scapegoat. By FUDing ETH, they aren't even perceived as "trashing one to shill another"; instead, their followers become genuinely convinced that ETH is simply inferior. This resentment is, of course, compounded by the memory of ETH's peak gas prices, which can be dozens of times higher than normal, cementing a deep-seated hatred for the platform.

This strategy is, in a sense, understandable. The **logic of "Crypto" is distinct from the logic of "Blockchain."** The vast majority of Crypto retail investors do not actually care if the performance is genuinely good. They might *temporarily* believe a new public chain like Monad will create the next legend, which in turn boosts the KOL's engagement and funnels their own money to the project's "whales" or market makers. However, when the token price inevitably drops, they will still sell, regardless of the fantasies the KOLs have woven.

The real problem is that this dynamic **severely impedes the actual progress of blockchain technology.** Each time a new public chain or a so-called "innovation" appears, capital and attention are immediately diverted. A few concepts get hyped, and a few new coins pump.

But ask this: to date, has Crypto produced a *single breakout dApp* that has crossed over into the mainstream? The only thing that gained internal traction was "Ape." Are there any real insights to be drawn from that? When new "web3-native" gimmicks are launched, does the Web2 world pay *any* attention? Why, for over a decade, has Crypto remained an insular echo chamber, stuck in a cycle of self-deception while "harvesting" its own retail base?

When capital and attention are constantly fragmented—shifting here today, there tomorrow—the market becomes exceedingly fragile. Crypto devolves into a zero-sum game of who can cash out first. This makes "harvesting" retail investors shockingly rapid and efficient, especially given the industry's extreme opacity and poor liquidity.

Day after day, investors wake up to find they have become the "exit liquidity." They quit the space, FUDing Crypto (and, unfortunately, blockchain technology by association) in their real lives. As some exit, others—often newcomers who heard prices are "down 90%" and enter to try their luck or because they believe they are smart enough to profit—arrive to "bottom-fish." The majority of these newcomers simply become the next wave of exit liquidity.

When will this vicious cycle end? The "safest" play in this environment is to treat Crypto as just another sector of tech stocks: BTC is the blue-chip leader, ETH is the secondary leader, and every other altcoin is just a speculative minion.

CZ (Changpeng Zhao) chants his "build" slogan daily. I don't know if, in the very beginning, he truly envisioned a world where Crypto would prosper. He certainly doesn't now. While one cannot deny that memes and other Crypto trends possess a unique "fun" that outsiders can't grasp, if the end result of this "fun" is 0.1% of people saying "Thank you, Crypto" while the other 99.9% exit, convinced that *blockchain itself is a scam*, then I would much prefer the entire industry shed this superficiality.

CZ’s "build" mantra alone is useless. Following his "HODL" advice might lead to personal profit, but *blockchain as a technology will lose*. The path from insiders shedding their biases to Crypto achieving mainstream integration is exceedingly long.

**99% of content in the Crypto space is about coins.** This is fundamentally wrong. KOLs, as the primary mouthpieces to the public, need to possess a measure of clarity beyond their (often questionable) professional ethics. With so many newcomers trying to enter Crypto these past two years, they should be setting an example—explaining what blockchain *actually* is, providing real education, and preparing the public for potential (and necessary) regulatory easing.

Instead, they propagate false narratives and cognitions that are detrimental to true prosperity.

However, regulatory easing is unfathomable amid the current culture of cyclical harvesting and hype. The KOLs, whose livelihoods depend on this chaos, likely prefer this phenomenon to continue indefinitely. **It is a deadlock.**

I remain boundlessly optimistic about the *technology* of blockchain.
But for the short-term future of "Crypto," I am precisely the opposite.
